Description: This package contains functions for computing, visualizing,
    and statistically evaluating the Absolute Between-ROC Area (ABROCA).
    The ABROCA is used as a tool to measure predictive fairness using the 
    predicted probabilities of observations from two or more predictive 
    models. For more information, see Gardner, Brooks, and Baker, 
    "Evaluating the Fairness of Predictive Student Models Through Slicing 
    Analysis," in Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Learning 
    Analytics and Knowledge (LAK19).
